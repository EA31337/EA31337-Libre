## Introduction

EA31337 Libre is free and open-source Forex multi-strategy trading robot written in MQL.

## About the project

The project aims to deliver simple implementation of
[EA31337 framework][gh-ea31337-classes] and [EA31337 strategies][gh-ea31337-strats].

The source code is compatible with MQL4 and MQL5 and can run on MetaTrader 4 and 5.

### Usage

You can freely use this project for education or research purposes.
However, **this project is not suitable for the real trading**
without relevant knowledge.

For more complex implementation of the same framework,
please follow alternative [EA31337][gh-ea31337] project.

### Strategies

The robot comes with over 35 strategies coordinated and controlled by the central algorithm.
Each strategy analyses market on multiple timeframes at the same time.
The market analysis is based on over 30 major technical indicators in real-time.

You are free to write your own custom strategies.

## Testing

### Backtesting

Please be aware that backtesting is a very complex process
and due to several MetaTrader 4 platform limitations, it cannot reliabily simulate the outcome.

The backtesting has been documented at [Backtesting using MT4][gh-wiki-backtest] wiki page.

Few notes to be aware when backtesting:

- Please use M1 timeframe to have access to multiple timeframes at the same time,
  as sometimes not all strategies would be activated (check the logs for details).
  This is due to platform limitations/bugs.
- Be aware that using
  [Birt's CSV2FXT.mq4](https://github.com/EA31337/Birt-CSV2FXT) script
  to generate FXT files is
  [outdated](https://eareview.net/tick-data/faq-troubleshooting) method
  and [buggy](https://github.com/EA31337/Birt-CSV2FXT/issues/3).
- There is no such thing as 99% modelling quality.
  It's a fake
  [hardcoded number](https://github.com/EA31337/MT-Formats/blob/master/fxt-405-refined.mqh#L53)
  when your FXT files are read-only and it's
  often used by scammers as a selling point.
- It's better to not set FXT/HST files as read-only,
  otherwise platform has no ability to validate and correct the data.
  When you force platform to use corrupted data, you get non-reliable results.
- When using generated FXT/HST files, run tests in off-line mode
  in order to not overlap your broker data onto your existing data,
  otherwise you get data errors, then you'd need to start from scratch.
